Java 8 introduced lambda expressions, which are concise and anonymous functions. It also brought the Stream API for efficient processing of collections, functional interfaces for lambda support, default methods in interfaces, method references for reusing existing methods, Optional class for null-safe operations, a new Date and Time API, and CompletableFuture for asynchronous programming.
